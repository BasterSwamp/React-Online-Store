# A multi-page React Online Store

ğŸ›’ A multi-page React Online Store project was created using the Redux library for easy application state management and further potential scaling.

In this project I use libraries:  
ğŸ”¹Redux - for application state management  
ğŸ”¹React-router-dom - for routing  
ğŸ”¹Redux Toolkit - to simplify and speed up the Redux experience  
ğŸ”¹Swiper - for creating adaptive sliders
